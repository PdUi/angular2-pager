## Compile the TypeScript to JavaScript

Run the TypeScript Compiler (TSC).

Open a terminal window in the root of the application folder and enter:

    npm run tsc

This script set the compiler watch option (-w) so the compiler stays alive when it's finished. It watches for changes to the .ts files and recompiles them automatically.

Leave this command running in the terminal window. 

*You can stop it anytime with Ctrl-C.*

## Run the app!

Open another terminal window in the root of the application folder and launch live-server by entering:

    npm start

live-server loads the browser, serves the HTML and JavaScript files and detects changes to the files and refreshes the browser page automatically.

Keep live-server running in this terminal window. 

*You can stop it anytime with Ctrl-C.*
